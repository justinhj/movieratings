# rottentomatoes

Clojure code to grab movie ratings from Rotten Tomatoes

## Usage

To use the Rotten Tomatoes API you need to get an API key and then set 
it as an environment variable on your system. For example:

export ROTTEN_TOMATOES_API_KEY="your key"

To find movie ratings for all movies with the text 'jaws' in the title

java -jar rottentomatoes-1.0.2-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar jaws

If no api key is found then the program falls back to grabbing the HTML content 
and scraping the desired values.

## Installation

Recommended route is to use leiningen
Should work with Eclipse or IntelliJ but I can't help with that

lein deps
lein uberjar 

## Emacs/Slime

In a terminal window do 'lein swank' then in emacs do `slime-connect' to start a REPL.

Do M-x slime-eval-buffer in the core.prj file then at a slime REPL do...

(in-ns 'rottentomatoes.core)
(-main "aliens")
